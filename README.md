## What is Arcemu?

Arcemu is a reimplementation of the World of Warcraft server, based on *OpenAscent*.
Historically it is referred to as *World of Warcraft server emulator*,
altough this is not correct.

Arcemu is made by a bunch of hobbists for learning and fun purposes and written in C++.
If you like it feel free to contribute or make pull requests.

It is a free software. This means you can get it without paying anything. You are also
allowed to have the source code (in fact we distribute the source only). You can
redistribute it, modify it, use it and do whatever you want with it as far as you respect
the terms and conditions in the GNU AGPL license.
