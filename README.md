## What is Arcemu?

Arcemu is a reimplementation of the World of Warcraft server, based on *OpenAscent*.
Historically it is referred to as *World of Warcraft server emulator*,
altough this is not correct.

Arcemu is made by a bunch of hobbists for learning and fun purposes and written in C++.
If you like it feel free to contribute or make pull requests.
