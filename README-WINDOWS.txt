ArcEmu Win32/64 Installation Instructions
=========================================

Read trunk\extras\arcemu-windows-libraries\README.txt


COLLISION:

Collision.dll will be compiled into a directory like this:

x64
trunk\win\VC90\x64\Release

x64 - debug
\win\VC90\x64\Debug

I hope this is understandable biggrin.gif

\win\VC90\x64\Release\collision.dll
Just move the collision.dell into your BIN folder after you compile!

The Lib file will be compiled by default so don't worry about it :)
