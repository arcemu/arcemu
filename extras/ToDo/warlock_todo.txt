bug:Phase Shift(imps spell) only visual
How it should work:Phase Shift makes the Imp invulnerable to all hostile and beneficial abilities, with the exception of Soul Link and Health Funnel. Phase shift can be canceled simply by clicking the spell icon. The Imp cannot attack while in this state; if it attacks, it will automatically cancel Phase Shift. It has a 10 second cooldown and does not cost the Imp any mana to use, however, it can only be cast while out of combat.
