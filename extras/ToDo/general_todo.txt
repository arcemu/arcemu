Char: Lvl 20 Warlock
Mobs: Stonesplinter Bonesnapper f.e. http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=1164
Used Spells:
Fear, http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=5782
Corruption, http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=6222
Curse of Agony http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=1014
If you attack the Mob and use Corruption and Curse of Agony it happens sometimes that they will regen HP ONCE directly AFTER the debuff runs out. If you use fear on them, they will regenerate about 10% of life each tick.
Easy to reproduce.
You will only see this on low lvl mobs I bet high level regen the same but due the more dmg dealt to them in higher levels this won't really noticed.
