*        Default is 8 hrs rest for one bubble. Raising this rate causes RestedXP to be earned faster,
*        F.e, setting a rate of 2 makes you require only 4 hrs reesting for 1 bubble (instead of 8).

*    Drop(Color):
*        These values will be multiplied by the drop percentages of the items for creatures
*        to determine which items to drop. All default to 1.

*        of each quality group.

*
*    Save:

*        by this value.
*        Default: 1
