*        Default is 8 hrs rest for one bubble. Raising this rate causes RestedXP to be earned faster,

*

*        by this value.
*        Default: 1
*
*    SkillRate:
*        The amount of "levels" your skill goes up each time you gain a level is multiplied

*        This is the interval at which movement packets will be flushed to the client, i.e. compressed/sent.
*        If you have a high threshold, keeping this at 1-2 seconds will work better.
*        Default: 1000 (one second)
*
*    CompressionRate
*        This is the deflate compression rate. Higher will use more cpu, but smaller packets.
*        Range: 1-9 (or 0 is disable)
*        Default: 1
*
*    CompressionThreshold
*        This is the distance that will be used to determine if an object needs to be sent compressed or
*        normal. It is advised to keep it at least 30 units. This value is used for players.
*        Default: 30.0
*
*    CompressionThresholdCreatures
*        This is the distance that will be used to determine if an object needs to be sent compressed or
*        normal. This value is used for creatures, so it can be a lot lower.
*        Default: 10.0
