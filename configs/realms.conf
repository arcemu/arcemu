*    TimeZone:
*      The location of the server (1=Development, 2=United States, 3=Oceanic, 4=Latin America, 
*       5=Tournament, 6=Korean, 8=English, 9=German, 10=French)
*
*    Population:
*      (0 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high)
*
*   Important information below
*
*
*	To make your server public and for you to be able to connect to it, please read this entirely.
*
*
* We added two more realms to the default, why? Because of how internal networking works - each outside IP to your IP needs a connection to listen on for players/you to be able to log into.
* This issue came up alot and MANY poorly written guides also came up with modifications to the host list in windows and a bunch of other fallacies.
* Using these new "three realm" configs you don't have to follow any guides but this one.
*
*	<Realm1 Name = "My Realm Name"
*		Address = "internet-url-or-ip:8129" 
*		Icon = "PVP"
*		Population = "1.0"
*		TimeZone = "2">
*	
*	<Realm2 Name = "Private"
*		Address = "internal-ip-address-for-lan-access:8129" 
*		Icon = "PVP"
*		Population = "1.0"
*		TimeZone = "1">
*
*	<Realm3 Name = "Localhost"
*		Address = "localhost:8129" 
*		Icon = "PVP"
*		Population = "1.0"
*		TimeZone = "1">
*	
*	EXPLANATION:
*
*	These three realms are all one realm, all making different listening IPs so others may log into the world.
*
*	Realm1 is the public realm, people outside of your network log into this.
*
*	Realm2 is the IP of the computer hosting the server. It will most commonly be a 192.168.*.* IP. NOT YOUR OUTSIDE/INTERNET IP. This is so other computers in your local arena network can connect to the realm.
*
*	Realm3 is the localhost connection, you will be using this to log into your server if you host and login to the server from the SAME computer.
*
*	Realmlist would then be the IP that is suitable for you to use in your setup, players will use the realm1 URL - while you use either realm2 or realm3 depending on the server setup.
*
*	You can cleanup the unused realms you made while doing this process if you have any, however even if you use a Realm3 type configuration to login, remember local network users on the same LAN as you will use Realm2 to login. 
*
*	To obtain your LAN IP address on:
* Windows = windows-key+r > type "cmd" > type "ipconfig" > under "IPV4 Address:"
* Linux = terminal > type "ifconfig" > under eth0's "inetaddr:"
*	To obtain your INTERNET IP:
* Go to: http://www.whatsmyip.org/
* Foward ports: 3724 (Realmlist) and 8129 (World) 
* If you add more outside(public) realms remember that their world ports need forwarding too.
